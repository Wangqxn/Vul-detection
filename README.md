# Vul-detection
## Code module  
This module includes source code feature extraction (source_code_feature_extraction), executable feature extraction (executable_feature_extraction), feature fusion, and model training (Fusion&Training). Please replace the data saving paths in Training.py with your actual paths.
## Datasets module  
This module includes the dataset used during our model's runtime. If you require data in additional formats, please contact us.
## Results
In this module, we present partial runtime results from both the Devign and code_vulnerability_java datasets. To maintain appropriate length for the paper, we have retained only the discussion of the Reveal dataset in the manuscript.
